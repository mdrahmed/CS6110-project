## Abstract
The prevalence of security vulnerabilities in software systems is a major concern for developers and users alike. Even a single vulnerability can have serious consequences, such as data breaches, system failures, or even physical harm. C is a commonly used programming language for developing software systems, including safety-critical systems, and it is therefore important to ensure that C programs are secure and free from vulnerabilities.

The goal of this project is to use Frama-C, a software analysis platform designed to support the development of safety-critical software, to detect and verify security vulnerabilities in C programs. By using Frama-C, we can identify potential vulnerabilities in C code, including buffer overflows, race conditions, and other memory-related issues. Meanwhile, we hope to get more semantic meaning to detect more high-level vulnerabilities or security problems.
    
The prospect of this project lies in the potential to improve the security and reliability of C programs, especially those used in safety-critical systems such as medical devices, aerospace systems, and industrial control systems. By identifying and verifying security vulnerabilities in C code using Frama-C, we can reduce the risk of system failures, data breaches, and other security incidents that could have serious consequences.
    
In this project, we can make a contribution to the field of software engineering by providing a practical approach to detecting and verifying security vulnerabilities in C programs. By using Frama-C, we can improve the safety and reliability of C programs and help ensure that software systems are secure and free from vulnerabilities.
